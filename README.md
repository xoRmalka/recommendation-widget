# Vanilla JS - Recommendation Widget

## Introduction
The Vanilla JS Recommendation Widget project aims to create a versatile recommendation widget using the Taboola REST API. The widget displays both organic and sponsored recommendations, allowing users to interact with them seamlessly.

## Objective
The primary goal was to design and implement a recommendation widget using Vanilla JavaScript. Leveraging the Taboola REST API, the widget fetches recommendations and presents them in an intuitive interface. The widget is responsive, functional, and easily extendable for future enhancements, such as adding new recommendation types.
